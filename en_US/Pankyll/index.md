description: A static site generator using pandoc

---

`Pankyll` is a static `HTML` site generator written in `Python` that can create
a static web site from `Markdown` files via `Pandoc`. It supports themes with
syntax highlighting and `PDF` creation.

`Pandoc` is a versatile tool to convert documents on the command line to and
from various formats. It can generate nice `PDF` from `Markdown` for example,
but also `HTML`.
