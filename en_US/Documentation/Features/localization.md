The usage of the localization (l10n) feature is mandatory, even if you use just
one language (as opposed to none), as many other parts and features of
[Pankyll] depend on at least one language. Which language is up to you. It
could be 'en_US' or 'de_DE' or what ever language you prefer. A minimal
configuration snippet for `cfg.yaml` looks like this.

```yaml
# 2. Feature: Internationalization
#    at minimum you have do define 1 language (the default)
locales:
      en_US: English
```

> A configuration for two languages looks like this.

```yaml
locales:
      en_US: English
      de_DE: Deutsch
```
