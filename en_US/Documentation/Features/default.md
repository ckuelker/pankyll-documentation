Some values need to have pre-defined values, so called default values.
[Pankyll] explicitly supports for some values that this values are set to a
default value for the whole web site.

## Site cfg.yaml Example

```yaml
default:
    page_type:         doc
    keyword_page_type: keyword
    index_list_type:   list
    l10n_locale:       en_US
    pdf_create:        False
    css_local:         False
    js_local:          False
```

### page_type

Every theme has different kind of web pages in its template layout directory.
Usually the front matter defined with the key `page_type:` the kind of template
to be used.  For example the `page_type: doc` uses the
`themes/NAME/layouts/doc/index.html` as a template to render the page. (Replace
`NAME` with name of the used [theme]. There are cases in which almost all pages
of a given web site are of one type. Rather forcing to add a `page_type:` in
every page front matter, this default value sets the page type for pages
without a `page_type:` in the front matter. The possible values are dependent
on the theme. Every theme can define as many page types as the theme wants.

### Example Values For 3 Themes

| Theme          | Page Types
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| newspaper      | title, keyword, doc, blog |
| rankle         | title, keyword, doc, blog |
| simplicissimus | title, keyword, doc, blog |

### keyword_page_type

Similar to the `page_type` one can set a default type for keyword pages.
Usually the `page_type` is set for `index.md` files. While also for every
keyword, like **tags** or **cotegories** also `index.md` files are created
automatically, this files can have a different default type determined by
`keyword_page_type:`. This is because the page of a keyword usually need to
have different kind of lists to show all keywords, that are not practically on
`title` pages for example. It is possible to set the value to the all values of
`page_type`, see above section for details.

### index_list_type

On some pages you would like to have an automatically generated link list of
sibling pages. This can be done in two ways. (1) creating a directory without
and `index.md` page. In this case the `index.md` page will be created with the
default list type specified by `index_list_type:`. (2) You create an `index.md`
file or any other file inside a directory containing sibling pages and define
`list: True` or `cards: True` inside the front matter. Also in cases a list
will be printed if this option matches the `index_list_type:` value.  For now
[Pankyll] supports 3 kind of listings, of which only two can be used as values:
either '`list` or `cards`. A theme can but do not need to support any list.

### Siblings

* list     - simple list for title, doc, and blog pages
* cards    - a different kind of layout list for title, doc and blog pages

### Keywords

* keyword - a special list for keywords

## l10n_locale

As [Pankyll] support multilinugal pages, it is assumed that a page has at least
one language. The key `l10n_locale:` require the name of the locale, that is
basically the top level directory of your content folder. If you would like to
create a German page your content directory might look like this
`content/de_DE/index.md`, than `de_DE` is the default locale and you should set
`l10n_locale: de_DE`.  If you would like to create an English page your content
directory might look like this `content/en_US/index.md`, than `en_US` is the
default locale and you should set `l10n_locale: en_US`.

## pdf_create

[Pankyll] supports the creation of [PDF] version if the [Markdown] page via
[Pandoc]. Some pages would like to have a link pointing to download the [PDF]
version of a page, some sites would not. Also when developing a new web site,
the creation of [PDF] pages takes time. To speed up the development, the
creation can be globally enabled or disabled for the site. As a remark, for now
[Pankyll] do not create [PDF] documents for `index.md` pages. Just use a
different page name for now. To enable [PDF] creation set the key to `True`
like this: `pdf_create: True` and to disable it to: `pdf_create: False`. Keep
in mind that [YAML] is case sensitive. `pdf_create: true` might not work.

## css_local

Some themes (or your site) might offer the delivery of [CSS] files locally
as in contrast to point to some arbitrary third party web servers. There are
advantages and disadvantages for this. `css_local: True` might deliver some
CSS locally from some themes or sites, while `css_local: False` do not.
You have to look into your theme to see if it supports it.

### Example Theme Support Template Snippet

```html
{% if cfg.default.css_local %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/hljs/highlight-default.min.css">
{% else %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//SOME_SERVER/styles/default.min.css">
{% endif %}
```

For this to work locally you have (1) copy `highlight-default.min.css`
(obtained from some web site) to
`themes/NAME/static/css/highlight-default.min.css` and (2) set `css_local:
True` in `cfg.yaml`.

## js_local

This option is basically the same as `css_local`, but just for [javascript]
files. See section [css_local](#css_local) for details.
