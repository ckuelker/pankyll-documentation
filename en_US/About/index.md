description: A static website generator using Pandoc

---

[Pankyll] can be used to convert a directory of [Markdown] files to [HTML]
pages and this pages can be copied to a server. That is called a static [HTML]
website generator. This in contrast to dynamic created [HTML] pages. While in
the past dynamic [HTML] pages have been quite popular, recently static [HTML]
pages gain in popularity. One reason for this is the security aspect, as static
[HTML] files do not suffer from many security risks as dynamic created pages.
On top of this the website can be served fast, which among other factors will
increase the scoring of search engines, the so called Search Engine
Optimization (SEO).

[Pankyll] uses [Pandoc] to convert a [Markdown] files to [HTML] and if
configured also to [PDF]. [Pandoc] a versatile tool on the command line can
convert from and to various formats. [Pandoc] uses [LaTeX] internally to create
[PDF] documents and as such this documents are typographically advanced in
comparison to documents created by standard word processors like Libre Office
or their proprietary siblings.
