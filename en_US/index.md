[Pankyll] is is a static [HTML] site generator written in [Python] using
[Pandoc] to generate easy to deploy [HTML] sites including [PDF] conversion
from [Markdown] files. This site provides [user documentation] about installing
and using the static site generator [Pankyll] for your site and it collects
unique layouts, called [themes] and [example] repositories for [themes]. The
latest version of this [documentation] can be found at the [Pankyll] web page
[https://www.pankyll.org] and it can be cloned via the [documentation git
